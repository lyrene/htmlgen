        <p>WERpapers is a repository dedicated exclusively to publishing the proceedings of the Workshop on Requirements Engineering (WER). 
            These articles presented in WER are meticulously selected by a committee through a rigorous double-blind review process. 
            WERpapers does not charge any fees for publication in the repository.</p>
       
        <h4>Committee</h4>
        <p>The committee organizing the WER is composed of editors, track chairs, program committee members, and local organizers.</p>
        
        <p>Editors: Every year, a new group of researchers takes on the responsibility for the workshop's scientific program, 
            for inviting the Program Committee (Editorial Board), for managing the submission, 
            selection and review processes, as well as, organizing the Proceedings. 
            After completing all these processes, the Editors forward the proceedings and the articles to the WERpapers team for publication on the WERpapers platform. </p>
        <p>Track Chairs: Since 2021, track chairs have assisted the editors in organizing specific tracks. </p>
        <p>Local Organization: Each year, local chairs handle event logistics, venue setup, technical support, and participant registration.</p>
        <p>Editors and editorial board information is available in the WER proceedings website while track chairs and local organization information is on the prefaces of the proceedings. </p>
